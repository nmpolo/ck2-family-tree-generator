# CK2 Family Tree Generator

This script parses a *.ck2 save file and generates a family tree. Resultant family tree is stored in HTML.

The script also lists the primary title held by a person, down to Baron/Baroness.

Savefile needs to be stored in the same directory.

It's not ready yet, but basic functionality is implemented and it can be used.
